This is part 2 of the Forms Project in The Odin Projectâ€™s Ruby on Rails Curriculum. Find it at http://www.theodinproject.com

The webpage is as ugly as it gets, since my objective here is to be proficent with the back-end side of things,
my philosophy is that first everything has to work, then you can think on how to make things pretty.

So, as far as the scope of this project goes, I am satisfied with the result, knowing that I can take this piece of page whenever I want and then perform all kinds of front-end magic to make it look new-gen style.
